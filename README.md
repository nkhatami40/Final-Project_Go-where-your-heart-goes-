The aim of this project is to identify the main causes of death all around the world, develop a model to predict the most important cause of death (heart disease) and recommend a diet to patients with a heart disease. 

The steps that have been taken in this project are as follows:
1- Using a cause of death dataset in order to identify the most significant cause, which was heart disease.
2- Using the heart disease dataset in order to analyze the effect of different factors on having a heart disease.
3- Evaluating the potential of different machine learning models for predicting the heart disease.
4- Using Streamlit to show the the results of the predictions in the format of an application.
5- Using food dataset to analyze different nutritions that are in various types of foods and distinguish which foods are not beneficial for patients with a heart disease.
6- Using streamlit to show the results of the analysis as a food recommender application.
